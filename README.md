## 🔐 Security Note

The name **`stickup`** was previously used in 2023 for a malicious crate which has since been removed from crates.io. (I wasn't aware of this at the time of publishing.)

This version — authored by [Belegrade Studio](https://belegrades.gg) — is a **clean and fully rewritten project**, unrelated to the original.

- ✅ No `build.rs`  
- ✅ No network activity  
- ✅ 100% open and auditable  

Transparency and trust matter. You're welcome to inspect the source or reach out directly.

**StickUp** is a modular, high-performance input abstraction layer for Rust applications.  
It handles physical and virtual devices with precision, persistence, and simplicity.

> Created by **Belegrade Studio**. Part of the **CelerisTech** suite.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔌 Plug-and-play device management (`hidapi` + virtual devices)
- 🎮 Clean `Device` trait: axis + button abstraction
- 🧠 Persistent device identity — robust rebinding & hotplugging
- 📋 Snapshot state or stream real-time `InputEvent`s
- 🔧 Flexible `BindingProfile` system to map inputs to actions
- ⚙️ Feature flags (`hid`, `virtual`) to tailor backend support
- 💡 Minimal dependencies. Built for tools, overlays, engines, and more.

---

## 📦 Installation

```toml
stickup = { version = "0.1.4", features = ["hid", "virtual"] }
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```rust
use stickup::DeviceManager;

fn main() {
    let mut manager = DeviceManager::new();
    let snapshot = manager.snapshot();

    for (id, state) in snapshot.iter() {
        println!("Device: {}", id);
        for (axis, value) in &state.axes {
            println!("  Axis {} = {}", axis, value);
        }
        for (button, pressed) in &state.buttons {
            println!("  Button {} is {}", button, if *pressed { "pressed" } else { "released" });
        }
    }
}
```

---

## 🧬 Device Identity

StickUp assigns a stable fingerprint to each device based on its hardware signature:

```text
vendor_id:product_id:serial_number
# Example: 044f:0402:ABCD1234
```

If the device provides a serial number, this ID is persistent across USB ports, reboots, and sessions — perfect for rebindings, multi-device setups, and simulators.

---

## 🔍 Examples

Run with `cargo run --example <name>`:

- `poll`: Print a snapshot of all connected device states
- `virtual_demo`: Feed manual input into a simulated device

---

## 🛠️ Optional Features

- `hid` (enabled by default): HID device support
- `virtual`: Simulated input devices

---

## 🧭 Philosophy

StickUp isn’t just about input. It’s about clarity, intentional systems, and persistent presence.  
Built for tools that know what they're listening to.

---

## 📜 License

Licensed under the **Pact of the Amaranth Rite**. See `LICENSE` for terms.  
Inspired by the MIT license, with deeper philosophical roots.

This crate uses `hidapi`, licensed under MIT or Apache-2.0.
